# elm-simple-paint-online-ElmUI
Port of my paint to elm-ui library

If you are here, you probably know how to run elm-ui app. And how hard it is on windows machine (my dev env).

Anyway...
in ./backend directory:
```
npm install && npm start
```
in ./ directory:
```
elm-ui install && elm-ui build && elm-ui server
```
Then open localhost:8001 on few browsers and enjoy that amazing paint.

If you are on windows and have some troubles, try to turn off all antiviruses, firewalls, use git bash console.
And don't forget to install https://github.com/gdotdesign/elm-github-install !!!
